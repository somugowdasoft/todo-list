#To-Do List Application
Overview
This is a simple and responsive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, manage, and filter tasks easily. This version does not use local storage, so the tasks will not persist when the page is refreshed.

#Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks with a description.
Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.
Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, and these tasks will be visually differentiated.
Filters: The application includes filters to view "All", "Completed", or "Incomplete" tasks.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.
styles.css: The CSS file that styles the To-Do List, ensuring a clean and responsive layout.
app.js: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for adding, deleting, marking tasks as completed, and filtering tasks.
